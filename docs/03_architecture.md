## 3. Architecture

### 3.0 C4 Model

[C4 model](https://c4model.com/) is a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems. <br>

As can be found on the website of the author of this model ([Simon Brown](https://simonbrown.je/)): *The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase* <br>

*Model C4* defines 4 levels (views) of the system architecture: *System Context*, *Container*, *Component* and *Code*. Below are examples of each of these levels that describe the architecture of this system. <br>

*Note: The [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) (diagram as text) component was used to describe all C4 model levels. Additionally, for levels C1-C3, a [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) plug-in connecting PlantUML with the C4 model was used*.
